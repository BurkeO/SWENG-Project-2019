Firebase setup:
This is required if you wish to link the app to a different firebase account.
1. Go to http://firebase.google.com/
2. Sign in with an email to get started
3. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and you should be greeted with a screen like this : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/StartScreen.png
4. Press on add project : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/AddProject.png
5. Fill out the form, naming the project (this can be anything) and choosing what region you want the database hosted in.
6. Once you have created the project, you should arrive at the projects overview page.
7. Press on the add app button : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/ProjectDashboard.png
8. Choose android as the platform
9. Next you will see a form where you need to add the package name of the app, you can find this in android studio, for this app it is com.example.vmac.WatBot : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/RegisterApp.png
10. Once youâ€™ve added the app and debug signing certificate (optional), you now need to download the google-services.json file, and replace the existing one in the project in the directory shown in the screenshot : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/AddingJson.png
11. After this the app should be up and running with the new firebase account.
