1. Go to [Firebase website](http://firebase.google.com/)
2. Sign in with an email to get started
3. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and you should be greeted with a screen like [this]( https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/StartScreen.png)
4. Press on [add project](https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/AddProject.png)

6. Once you have created the project, you should arrive at the projects overview page.
7. Press on the add app [button]( https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/ProjectDashboard.png)
8. Choose android as the platform
9. Next you will see a form where you need to add the package name of the app, you can find this in android studio, for this app it is com.example.vmac.WatBot : [example](https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/RegisterApp.png)
10. Once youâ€™ve added the app and debug signing certificate (optional), you now need to download the google-services.json file, and replace the existing one in the project in the directory shown in the [screenshot](https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/AddingJson.png)
11. After this the app should be up and running with the new firebase account. 

Keep in mind the website may change in the future but as of 6/4/19 this is the proceedure required.

This is currently how the database looks, messages that have been exchanged can be found by expanding the chatRooms section : https://github.com/BurkeO/SWENG-Project-2019/blob/master/Documentation/FirebaseSetup/Database.png


## IBM Watson setup:
This is required if you wish to link the app to a different IBM account.
1. Go to [IBM Watson Assistant page](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
2. Sign up for a free IBM Cloud account or log in.
3. Click **Create**. 
4. After you create a Watson Assistant service instance, you land on the Manage page of the service dashboard. Take note of **API key** and **URL** provides. Put this API key into the *config.xml* file in *app/src/main/res/values/* under *assistant_apikey* and URL under *assistant_url*.
5. Click **Launch tool**. If you're prompted to log in to the tool, provide your IBM Cloud credentials.
6. From the home page of the Watson Assistant tool, click **Create a Skill**.
7. When a skill is created, add Intents and Dialogues to it. On the home page, you can find video tutorials made by IBM that show how to create a working assistant.
8. When assistant is ready, go back to **Skills** and switch to **Assistants** page. 
9. Create new Assistant and add the skills just created to it. Under **View API Details** for the assistant, make note of the **Assistant ID**. Insert this into *config.xml* under *assistant_id*.
10. The app will now call the new assistant created.
NB. This is valid as of 07/04/2019. Please, visit IBM Watson website for any updates and changes.

5. Do the same for [Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) service. Put the API key into the *config.xml* file in *app/src/main/res/values/* under *TTS_apikey*. Put URL into the same file under *TTS_url*.
